<h1 align='center'>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Camps - backend | MERN application</h1>
<br />
<h3>Project information</h3>
<br />
<p align='center'>My goal with this project was to allow the BJJ interested people to book training camps in different parts of the world. Based on their belt degree, and the amount of money they want to pay. The project is also implemented with Paypal and VISA system using braintree API. A user can book, filter, search camps. A user can also login, register and browse certain parts of the webpage without having to create an account. There is also an Admin route, where the admin can delete or add a camp. An admin is also authorized to delete or update a user. For example, an admin can upgrade a user from white to blue belt. </p>
